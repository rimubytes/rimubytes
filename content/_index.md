### Hey there 👋

I'm Marvin, a software engineer with a thrill for infrastructure. I specialize in building resilient systems, ensuring uptime, and driving efficiency through automation and monitoring. My expertise lies in applying SRE principles to manage and improve production systems while enhancing performance and reliability.

I bridge the gap between development and operations, focusing on creating scalable infrastructure, automating complex tasks, and preventing outages. From Kubernetes orchestration to Root Cause Analysis , I’m driven by a commitment to operational excellence.

As a Site Reliability Engineer, I focus on:

- **Reliability & Availability:** Designing and implementing high-availability systems that minimize downtime and ensure services meet SLAs.

- **Incident Management & RCA:** Leading Root Cause Analysis efforts, mitigating incidents quickly, and implementing long-term fixes to prevent recurrence.

- **Automation:** Utilizing tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Python to automate repetitive tasks, from infrastructure provisioning to failure recovery.

- **Monitoring & Observability:** Building comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems using Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack to ensure full observability across all environments.

- **Scalability:** Optimizing and automating infrastructure scaling to handle fluctuating workloads without compromising performance.
