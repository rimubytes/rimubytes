## Performance Optimization and Scalability

Optimized the performance and scalability of applications to handle increasing loads and ensure smooth user experiences.

## Conducted Performance Tuning and Load Testing

- **Load Testing with JMeter**: Utilized Apache JMeter to perform load testing, identifying bottlenecks and ensuring applications can handle high traffic volumes.
- **Performance Tuning Best Practices**: Implemented best practices for performance tuning, including database indexing, query optimization, and efficient resource utilization.

## Implemented Caching Strategies and Database Optimizations

- **Redis Caching Setup**: Configured Redis as a caching layer to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data.
- **Database Optimization Techniques**: Applied database optimization techniques such as normalization, denormalization, and indexing to enhance database performance and scalability.
