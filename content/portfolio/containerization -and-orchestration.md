Adopted containerization and orchestration technologies to improve application deployment and management.

## Deployed Containerized Applications using Docker and Kubernetes

- **Docker Compose for Microservices**: Utilized Docker Compose to manage multi-container Docker applications, simplifying development and testing environments.
- **Kubernetes Cluster Setup**: Configured and deployed Kubernetes clusters to orchestrate containerized applications, ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficient resource utilization.

## Implemented Service Mesh for Microservices Management

- **Istio Service Mesh Setup**: Implemented Istio to manage microservices communication, providing traffic management, security, and observability features.
- **Linkerd for Microservices**: Deployed Linkerd as a lightweight service mesh to enhance service reliability and performance, facilitating easier debugging and monitoring.

## Enhanced Deployment Strategies

- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Implemented blue-green deployment strategies to minimize downtime and reduce risk during application updates.
- **Canary Releases**: Adopted canary release methodologies to gradually roll out new features, allowing for monitoring and rollback if issues are detected.
