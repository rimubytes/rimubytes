Developed and maintained robust CI/CD pipelines to streamline the software development process, reduce deployment times, and improve release quality.

## Built CI/CD Pipelines using Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and GitHub Actions

- **Jenkins Pipeline for Microservices**: Created Jenkins pipelines to build, test, and deploy microservices architecture efficiently.
- **GitLab CI/CD for Kubernetes Deployments**: Leveraged GitLab CI/CD to automate deployments to Kubernetes clusters, enhancing scalability and reliability.
- **GitHub Actions for Serverless Deployments**: Implemented GitHub Actions workflows to deploy serverless applications seamlessly.

## Integrated Automated Testing, Security Scans, and Code Quality Checks

- **Automated Testing with Jenkins**: Integrated automated testing suites into Jenkins pipelines to ensure code quality and functionality.
- **Security Scans in CI/CD**: Incorporated security scanning tools into CI/CD pipelines to detect vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- **Code Quality Checks**: Utilized tools like SonarQube to maintain high code quality standards across all projects.
