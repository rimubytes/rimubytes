Enhanced the security posture of cloud infrastructure and applications through automated security tools and compliance checks.

## Implemented Automated Security Testing in CI/CD Pipelines

- **Security Testing with OWASP ZAP**: Integrated OWASP ZAP into CI/CD pipelines to perform automated security scanning, identifying vulnerabilities during the development process.
- **Static Code Analysis with SonarQube**: Utilized SonarQube for static code analysis, ensuring code quality and detecting potential security issues early.

## Ensured Compliance with Standards such as ISO 27001, SOC 2, and GDPR

- **Automated Compliance Checks**: Developed automated compliance checks using Terraform to enforce security and regulatory standards across cloud environments.
- **Compliance Reporting**: Implemented reporting mechanisms to generate compliance reports, facilitating audits and continuous compliance monitoring.
