Automated the provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, ensuring consistent and repeatable environments across multiple cloud providers.

## Implemented Multi-Cloud Deployments using Terraform and Pulumi

- **Terraform Scripts for Multi-Cloud Setup**: Developed Terraform scripts to deploy infrastructure across AWS, GCP, and Azure, ensuring consistency and scalability.
- **Pulumi Scripts for Multi-Cloud Setup**: Utilized Pulumi for more flexible infrastructure management with programming languages like TypeScript and Python.

## Automated Scaling and Cost Optimization Strategies

- **AWS Auto Scaling Configuration**: Configured AWS Auto Scaling groups to handle varying loads, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency.
- **GCP Cost Optimization**: Implemented strategies to monitor and reduce costs on Google Cloud Platform by optimizing resource usage.

## Ensured Infrastructure Compliance with Industry Standards

- **Compliance Automation with Terraform**: Integrated compliance checks into Terraform workflows to enforce security and regulatory standards automatically.
